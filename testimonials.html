"My son Grayson Dupont has been playing in the national developmental academy the past two seasons for the Atlanta based Concorde Fire USDA u-16's. Thru our travels back and forth to Atlanta we realized we needed to get some professional training here in Birmingham. A parent of a another Developmental Academy player recommended we call Coach Igor Popovich.

We called and arranged a training session immediately. Grayson thoroughly enjoyed his initial training session and wanted to book Coach Igor every time we were back in Birmingham. Grayson is now at Montverde Academy. The number one soccer academy in the nation. Thanks in part to Coach Igor's training with Grayson.

Coach Igor prepared training sessions 6 days a week at 7:00 am with Grayson for a few weeks prior to Grayson's Montverde tryouts.. Then after his offer to be a part of Monteverde Academy Coach Igor and rayson trained almost every morning for the next 50 days before he left for school.

As a parent I couldn't be more satisfied with the training and results from Coach Igor. From pricing, technical skill, intensity of training and schedule flexibility. I would recommend Coach Igor anytime you want the best results for your child".

Thank you, Chris Dupont




"I have known Coach Igor for many years both on and off the pitch and he has been training my son Bailey for the past 3 years. Since working with Igor I have watched Bailey’s confidence grow and soccer skill improve tremendously.


Coach Igor has a gift for combining a warm and friendly environment with a disciplined approach to his training sessions. Igor teaches proper skill development, tactics and strategy, always setting proper proper expectations for both parent and player. But most importantly, Igor’s instruction emphasizes the value of strong work ethic, perseverance, leadership, teamwork, sportsmanship, and goal setting. These are all valuable "life lessons" that will service an individual, both on and off the field.

Highly recommend Coach Igor to anyone who is serious about developing their skills as a competitive soccer player."

"Training with Coach Igor is fun. He pushes me for my top performance and gives me homework that I really enjoy each week. I can't wait to come back each week. He is definitely helping me get better. . He's super cool".

"Coach Igor is an awesome coach. Our daughter has trained weekly with him for one year and we look forward to training with him for years to come. Igor challenges her while making it enjoyable. Her game improves weekly under his leadership. Igor is energetic, dependable and punctual. She always leaves wanting more".

Clint and Leah Waggoner


"My daughter always looks forward to her Igor training sessions. Not only does she learn a ton, Igor is so encouraging that she always leaves feeling great about herself and confident about her abilities. She enjoys her one on one sessions with him as well as her sessions with her teammates. It has been a great experience and we have seen marked improvement since she has begun working with Igor".

Stephanie Smith



"Igor's soccer drills and training are tailored for each players individual development. We've seen great improvement in our daughter's soccer skills. Morgan's passes have become more crisper; she's gained confidence with the ball; she's developed a good warm up routine; and has become quicker with the ball.

Our daughter loves her training sessions with Igor! She feels very confident when she's training with him and that confidence follows her throughout the week".

Scott & Karen Snyder


"Coach Igor has helped me with believing that my choices aren't always wrong. He plans each drill to each players needs. Since I have been going to Coach Igor, I feel like my touches on the ball have improved. I look forward to each and every training session".

Morgan Snyder
