			</p>After graduating with a bachelor's degree in Business Managemnet at Faulkner University, Popovich moved to Bimingham to have surgery on broken cartilage on his right ankle. The surgery was done at St. Vincents Hospital at Dr, Andrews. Due to the injury Popovich could not go back to Vermont Voltage to play one more year in the USL and then go to the trials in Europe and Brazil that were lined up at that time. During the 8 months recovery time, Popovich started to work for Vestavia Hills High School as an assistant coach and then for Coerver Coaching South East. During the time with Coerver, he got involved with several youth players, training them privately or in small groups, helping them to raise their individual games and reach their goals.
